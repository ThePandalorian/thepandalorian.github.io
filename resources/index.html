These books, when written well, provide a great overview of a topic for the non-specialist, and can be a window into further reading. I am using popular science rather broadly here, to mean any books which do not require more than a high-school (or at most early undergraduate) background in the subject. As such, I may include books that may not, strictly speaking, be intended for a non-scientific audience. Below are some such books that I particularly liked. You can also find a list of popular science books on <a href="http://thejennionslab.weebly.com/fun-stuff.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Michael Jennions’ website</a>, and some ‘topicology’ books on <a href="https://www.kokkonuts.org/topicology/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hanna Kokko’s website</a>.</p> <h3 id="ecology-and-evolution">Ecology and Evolution</h3> <ul> <li> <i>Improbable Destinies</i> by Jonathan Losos - Predictability of evolution, long-term evolution</li> <li> <i>Beak of the finch</i> by Jonathan Weiner - long term evolution in wild populations</li> <li> <i>Darwin comes to town</i> by Menno Schilthuizen - urban evolution</li> <li> <i>The Loom of life</i> by Menno Schilthuizen - Community ecology.

While there are more and more articles these days that try to convince biologists that mathematics can be interesting and useful to biology, there are far fewer articles aimed towards people with a mathematics or physics background. Below are some articles from mathematicians that paint a very rich picture of mathematical biology as a field of interest for mathematicians.</p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556422001158" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vittadello and Stumpf 2022 - Open problems in mathematical biology</a>, a paper that shows how ‘modern’ mathematical biology has several mathematically interesting open problems that draw on diverse areas of mathematics including topology, algebra, analysis, probability theory, and statistical inference.</li> <li> <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202111/rnoti-p1882.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Constable, Krumbeck, and Rogers 2021 - An invitation to stochastic mathematical biology</a>, a paper that discusses various interesting open questions in mathematical biology that have to do with stochastic processes.

Eugene Wigner, an eminent physicist, once wrote a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1142/9789814503488_0018" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">famous essay</a> about the ‘unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences’. Though Wigner said ‘science’, he really only meant ‘physics’. Soon after, Israel Gelfand, a famous mathematician, informally commented that “There is only one thing which is more unreasonable than the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in physics, and this is the unreasonable ineffectiveness of mathematics in biology”, but sadly passed away without elaborating on this statement. The linked article is written by a mathematician and friend of Gelfand and discusses the ‘unreasonable ineffectiveness of mathematics in biology’ from a mathematical point of view and argues that we require entirely new mathematics in order to effectively tackle biological problems. Despite the depressing title, I think the article itself is quite exciting as a source of interesting and radically new potential areas of research for mathematicians.</li> <li> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-0513-9_1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Akin 1990 - The Differential Geometry of Population Genetics and Evolutionary Games</a>. A book chapter (appearing in <i>Mathematical and Statistical Developments of Evolutionary Theory</i>, Lessard Ed., Springer Dordrecht) discussing an approach to population dynamics using differential geometry. The basic idea is the following: It is well-known that population mean fitness may not be maximized over the course of evolution when natural selection is frequency-dependent. Thus, the simplistic idea of evolution as a steady ‘hill-climbing’ process towards ever-increasing mean fitness does not hold true for population with frequency-dependent selection. However, in an abstract sense, one can view the state space (usually a subset of the reals) not merely as a set, but as a Riemannian manifold. In this view, the Euclidean metric is just one of potentially many Riemannian metrics associated with the manifold, and each metric is associated with its own notion of gradients and maximization. It then turns out that under one particular choice of metric (the so-called ‘Shahshahani metric’), fitness <i>is</i> still maximized under the notions of maximization associated with this new metric. It bears noting that this exercise does not lead to any new biology, but instead an alternative mathematical viewpoint to try and rescue the idea of fitness maximization.</li> <li> <a href="https://nchampagnat.perso.math.cnrs.fr/ICM-Sylvie.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Champagnat, Méléard, and Tran 2022 - Multi-scale eco-evolutionary models: from individuals to populations</a>.

I very strongly disagree with the classification of most of the things covered in this piece as ‘physics’ or of any of the subject matter covered as ‘a field of physics’, but I include this survey here nevertheless for any stray physicists that may run into my page. This article surveys how tools first created in areas of physics such as statistical mechanics have been co-opted to study biological systems across various scales of biology. While the article is written by physicists and views these biological models as ‘areas of physics’, I urge you to notice that using a partition function (originally developed in the context of stat mech) to study ensembles of species in an ecological community is physics to the same degree that using calculus (originally developed in the context of Newtonian mechanics) to model Lotka-Volterra communities is physics :)</li> </ul> <hr> <h1 id="resources-for-academia-technical-skills">Resources for academia: technical skills</h1> <h2 id="data-visualization">Data visualization</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ggplot2 cheatsheet</a></li> <li><a href="https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Fundamentals of Data Visualization</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">A collection of graphs made in R</a></li> <li><a href="https://python-graph-gallery.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">A collection of graphs made in Python</a></li> <li> <a href="https://paletton.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">A color scheme generator</a> for making better plots: Generates complimentary colors, lets you vary hue, provides simulations of various types of colorblindness as well as common lightness/hue/saturation changes that can be caused by faulty screens.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="coding">Coding</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://goodresearch.dev/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The good research coding handbook</a></li> <li> <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pro git</a>, an introduction to using git and GitHub for version control</li> <li>The <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tidyverse</a>, a set of packages for data wrangling and data visualization in R</li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9HYL-VRX0oQOWAFoKHFQAsWAI3ImbNPk" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Using the tidyverse for data wrangling in R</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWjqLW-u3hc" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hands-on tutorial on using dplyr for data wrangling in R</a></li> <li><a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">A mapping of MATLAB functions to numpy functions in Python</a></li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/marcharper/python-ternary" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">python-ternary</a>, a library for making ternary plots in Python using matplotlib</li> <li>High-performance computing using SLURM: - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grZVs1UUxug" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Introduction to SLURM and job scripting</a> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJMQO7Ercw" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Creating batch scripts for SLURM</a></li> <li><a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/tutorials.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SLURM tutorial series by the makers themselves</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChcsBE6tJr8&amp;list=PL-g8n27Db1XfPrRvZMBSxK55_lIy39sqZ&amp;index=1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SLURM directives to put into a bash script</a></li> <li><a href="https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/python" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Using Python on the HPC</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="reading-writing-and-presentation">Reading, writing, and presentation</h2> <ul> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT9dtLV29xu8NkipEERDB2I62tLyhTJym" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Playlist on academic writing</a> by the Leadership Lab at UChicago</li> <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">How to speak</a> by Patrick Winston at MIT</li> <li><a href="https://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">List of commonly used phrases in academic writing</a></li> <li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030077" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ten simple rules for making good oral presentations</a></li> </ul> <hr> <h1 id="resources-for-academia-applications-and-advice">Resources for academia: Applications and advice</h1> <h2 id="other-lists-like-this-one">Other lists like this one</h2> <ul> <li> <a href="https://github.com/shaily99/advice" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shaily Bhatt’s repository of advice</a> on things like grad school applications and research.

Currently has notes on NLD (from Strogatz), genetics (chromosome mapping, transposons, genetic screens, forward &amp; backward genetics techniques, sequencing techniques, CRISPR-Cas), neurobiology (mostly cellular stuff; Hodgkin-Huxley and its precursor models), statistical inference (sufficient statistics, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, etc. from a math view. No prerequisites), graph theory (basic definitions, Eulerian and Hamiltonian graphs/paths/cycles, matching and perfect matching, vertex and edge cuts, max flow-min cut, intro to graph coloring, intro to Ramsey theory and extremal graph theory) , statistical mechanics (Covers all of Reif’s intro textbook, culminating in statistically deriving the laws of thermodynamics. No prerequisites), measure theory (abstract measure spaces, lebesgue integration, product measures and Fubini’s theorem, <i>L<sup>p</sup></i> spaces, Radon-Nikodym theorem, differentiation of measures; No prerequisites. Important results are presented in a separate document in case you don’t care for proofs), probability (Markov chains, intro to measure theoretic probability, martingale theory; Knowing measure theory is helpful for the second half, but all necessary results are introduced), stochastic processes (Markov chains ‘properly’, Brownian motion, stochastic calculus, SDEs; This needs some measure theory and probability, important results are presented in the first few pages) and PDEs (transport eqn, method of characteristics, Poisson eqn and associated results for harmonic functions, heat eqn, wave eqn, intro to Fourier transforms, their properties, and how to use them to solve PDEs; Notions such as <i>L<sup>p</sup></i> norms are used regularly, so familiarity with basic measure-theoretic notions will be useful.
